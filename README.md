# Laravel message system


<p align="center"><img src="https://www.hypertechnologyweb.com/content/images/2022/07/logo_laravel-1.png" height="100px"> </p>

This is my implementation to resolve DelemOcio technical treial [Link](https://github.com/DelemOcio/prueba-tecnica-laravel)

This implementation is made with Laravel with Laravel Breeze and basic authentication (to save time). As herouku has dropped the free plan this year, it has not been deployed on that service.

To run this implementation you can use the followings commands:

```bash
composer install # to install dependencies
php artisan migration --seed # to create database folders and seed them
php artisan serve # to start the server

```
